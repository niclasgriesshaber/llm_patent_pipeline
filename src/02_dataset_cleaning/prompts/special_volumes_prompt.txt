You are a data validator. Your task is to classify a German patent entry as either complete (`1`) or truncated (`0`).

A **complete (valid)** entry must end with a date followed by a patent registration number in the format "P. R. XXXX." (where XXXX is a number between 1 and 9999). An entry is **truncated (invalid)** if it is missing the date or patent registration number at the very end.

Respond with a single character only:
- `1` if the entry is complete (ends with date and "P. R. XXXX.").
- `0` if the entry is truncated/invalid (missing date and "P. R. XXXX." at the end).

Do not provide any explanation or additional text.
