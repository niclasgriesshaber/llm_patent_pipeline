You are a data validator. Your task is to classify a German patent entry as either complete (`1`) or truncated (`0`).

A **complete (valid)** entry must meet **both** of the following criteria:
1.  **Valid Start:** It must begin with a patent ID. A patent ID is a 1- to 6-digit number, which can be preceded by a dagger symbol (†) or an enumeration (e.g., "17.").
2.  **Valid End:** It must contain a date (in any recognizable format) near the end of the entry.

An entry is **truncated (invalid)** if it is missing either the patent ID at the beginning OR the date near the end.

Respond with a single character only:
- `1` if the entry is complete.
- `0` if the entry is truncated/invalid.

Do not provide any explanation or additional text.
