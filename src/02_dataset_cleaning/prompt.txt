A patent entry from an old German patent registry is provided below. A valid entry always starts with a patent number (single-digit up to six-digits, possibly preceded by enumeration) or a dagger symbol (†). A valid entry always has a date (in any format) close to the end. Entries may end with cryptic patent terminology like 'A – XYZ'. Between start and end, there is typically information about the patent holder, description, location, etc. Invalid entries are those that only contain a collection of patent numbers, only reference classes, or are otherwise incomplete. Only provide 1 or 0. Nothing else.
