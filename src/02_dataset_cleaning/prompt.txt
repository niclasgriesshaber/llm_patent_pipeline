You are a data validator. Your task is to classify a German patent entry as either complete (`1`) or truncated (`0`).

A **complete (valid)** entry must contain a date (in any recognizable format) near the end of the entry. An entry is **truncated (invalid)** if it is missing the date near the end.

Respond with a single character only:
- `1` if the entry is complete.
- `0` if the entry is truncated/invalid.

Do not provide any explanation or additional text.
