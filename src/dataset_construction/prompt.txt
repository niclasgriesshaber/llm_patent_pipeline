**Objective:** Perform information extraction from a German Patent Register page image (typically double-column format). Extract Classification Headings and valid Patent Entries sequentially into a flat JSON array. Preserve original German characters.

**Critical Instructions & Layout:**

1.  **Target Area:** Extraction MUST focus **exclusively** on the text content physically located **within the main content columns** (usually two columns, separated by a vertical gutter).
2.  **IGNORE Running Headers:** Text located in the **top margin** of the page (e.g., `Kl. X. Nr YYYYY		page number		Kl. X. Nr YYYYY`) serves ONLY for navigation in the original document. **This text MUST be completely ignored and discarded. DO NOT include it in the output.**
3.  **Reading Order:** Process text strictly column by column: Read the **entire left column from top to bottom**, then read the **entire right column from top to bottom**. Maintain this exact sequence in the output array.

**Extraction Targets & Detailed Rules:**

1.  **Classification Heading:**
    *   **Identification:** Identify text blocks *within the main content columns* that function as organizational headings. These divide categories of patent entries. They typically appear in one of these formats:
        *   **Main Heading:** Typically starts with "Klasse", followed by a number and period (e.g., `Klasse 1.`), and then descriptive text (e.g., `Aufbereitung von Erzen.`).
        *   **Sub-Heading:** Typically starts with a code (number + optional character + period, e.g., `1a.`, `85g.`), often followed by descriptive text.
    *   **Cross-References:** Text starting with "Vgl." (e.g., `Vgl. die Klassen 25, 41...`) appearing *immediately* below or alongside a Main or Sub-Heading, *before* the next distinct Patent Entry or the next Heading, is considered part of that *preceding* heading. Include it.
    *   **Extraction:**
        *   Capture the full, verbatim text of the heading, including any attached "Vgl." cross-references.
        *   **Line Break Handling:** Rejoin words hyphenated across lines (e.g., `Aufbereit-\nung` becomes `Aufbereitung`). Replace ALL *other* internal line breaks within the heading text with a single space.
        *   **Output:** Store the entire processed heading text as a single string value for the key `"category"`.

2.  **Patent Entry:**
    *   **Identification:** Identify distinct text blocks *within the main content columns* that represent an individual patent record. A valid Patent Entry MUST meet these criteria:
        *   Typically starts with a 5-6 digit number (the Patent Number). This number might be preceded by a symbol like `(†)` or a smaller group/item number with a period (e.g., `3. 299 583`).
        *   Crucially, it **MUST contain substantial descriptive text** characteristic of a patent record, typically including:
            *   Patent Holder Name(s) and Location(s).
            *   A technical Title/Subject description.
            *   Date(s).
    *   **CRITICAL EXCLUSION RULE (Number Lists):** **IGNORE AND DISCARD** any text block appearing directly under a Category Heading that consists *almost exclusively* of lists of patent numbers or reference codes (e.g., `55 306 A 115. - 55343 A 131. - 55403 A 149.`) and **LACKS the substantial descriptive elements** (Applicant Name, Title, etc.) defined above. These are *NOT valid Patent Entries.**
    *   **Extraction:**
        *   Capture the complete, verbatim text of *only valid* Patent Entries.
        *   **Line Break Handling:** Rejoin words hyphenated across lines (e.g., `ver-\nschiedenem` becomes `verschiedenem`). Replace ALL *other* internal line breaks within the entry text with a single space.
        *   **Output:** Store the entire processed entry text as a single string value for the key `"entry"`.
    *   **Accuracy:** Preserve all original German characters, capitalization, spelling, punctuation (including periods, commas, hyphens, em-dashes), and symbols (`(†)`) precisely after handling line breaks.

**Output Format Specification:**

*   Produce a single **JSON array** containing multiple JSON objects.
*   Each object in the array must have **exactly ONE key**:
    *   `{"category": "Full text of heading (single string, line breaks processed)"}`
    *   OR
    *   `{"entry": "Full text of valid patent entry (single string, line breaks processed)"}`
*   The objects MUST appear in the array strictly following the **Reading Order** (left column top-to-bottom, then right column top-to-bottom).
*   If multiple Category Headings (e.g., Main + Sub, or Sub + Sub) appear consecutively without any patent entries between them, represent them as sequential `{"category": ...}` objects in the output array.

**Example Output Structure:**

```json

    "category": "Klasse 1. Aufbereitung von Erzen, Mineralien und Brennstoffen. Vgl. die Klassen 40 und 50."
  },
  {

```

*Final Instruction:* Adhere strictly to these rules. Prioritize correct identification of the main content columns, exclusion of running headers and number lists, and accurate transcription/line break processing. The output MUST be only the specified JSON array. Nothing else.
