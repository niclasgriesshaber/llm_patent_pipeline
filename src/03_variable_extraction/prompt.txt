You will be provided with a single text entry from Germany's Imperial Patent Office. Your task is to function as a highly precise information extraction engine. You must carefully analyze the entry and extract specific fields, formatting the output as a single, valid JSON object.

**Core Principles:**
*   **Exactness:** All extracted text must be an *exact, character-for-character copy* from the source text. Do not add, remove, or alter any characters, including historical German characters (e.g., ſ).
*   **Structure:** The patent entries almost always follow a specific order: `patent_id` -> `name(s)` -> `location(es)` -> (optional `Vertreter` info) -> `description` -> (optional addendum note) -> `date` -> (optional addendum note). Use this predictable structure to guide your extraction.
*   **Output Format:** The output MUST be a single JSON object with the keys: `patent_id`, `name`, `location`, `description`, and `date`. If a value cannot be reliably found for a field, use the string "NaN".

**Detailed Extraction Rules:**

**1. `patent_id` (String)**
*   **Location:** The patent ID is the numerical identifier at the beginning of the entry.
*   **Format:** It is a one- to six-digit number.
*   **Rule:** You MUST ignore any non-digit prefixes. This includes list enumerations (e.g., `1.`, `17.`), symbols (e.g., `(†)`), dashes, or spaces. Extract ONLY the numeric digits.
*   **Example:** For `(†) 2. 35321. — ...`, you must extract `"35321"`.

**2. `name` (String)**
*   **Location:** This is the name of the patent holder(s), which immediately follows the `patent_id`.
*   **Rule:** Extract the full name(s) exactly as written.
    *   Include corporate forms (e.g., `AKTIEN-GESELLSCHAFT FÜR BERGBAU- UND ZINKHÜTTENBETRIEB`).
    *   Include academic or professional titles (e.g., `Dr.-Ing.`).
    *   Include all parts of compound names (e.g., `SCHIFFER & KIRCHER`).
    *   **CRITICAL:** Do NOT extract occupations or job descriptions that may appear with names. Extract only the actual names and titles.
*   **CRITICAL:** This field is for the patent holder ONLY. Do NOT extract the name of the representative (`Vertreter`). The representative's name, if present, appears later in the text and must be ignored for this field.

**3. `location` (String)**
*   **Location:** This is the location of the patent holder, and it almost always follows the holder's `name` directly. It is often introduced by a preposition like `in` or `auf`.
*   **Rule:** Extract the entire location phrase associated with the patent holder(s).
    *   Include all details: city, state, country (e.g., `in Kladno, Böhmen`, `in Chicago, V. St. A.`).
*   **CRITICAL:** Do NOT extract the location of the representative (`Vertreter`). The correct location is the one directly linked to the `name` you extracted in the previous step.

**4. `description` (String)**
*   **Location:** This is the patent's subject matter. It is the text located *after* the holder's name/location and *before* the final date.
*   **Rule:** Extract the core descriptive text. This can be as short as a single word. You must apply the following two exclusion rules:
    *   **Exclusion 1: Representative Information:** You MUST completely exclude any block of text detailing a representative. This block often starts with `Vertreter:` and includes their name, title, and location.
    *   **Exclusion 2: Addendum Notes:** You MUST completely exclude any parenthetical notes about patent addendums. These notes look like `(Zusatz zum Patent 12345.)` or `(II. Zusatz zum Patent 17502.)` and are usually found at the end of the description, just before the date.
*   After applying these exclusions, extract the remaining text for the description.

**5. `date` (String)**
*   **Location:** The date is located at the very end of the entry.
*   **Rule:** Extract the date string *exactly* as it appears. If multiple dates are present in the entry, the correct one is always the date referring to the German registration.
