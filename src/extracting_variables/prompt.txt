You will be provided with a single text entry describing a German patent record at the very end. Your task is to carefully read this entry and extract specific pieces of information, formatting the output as a single JSON object.

The JSON object MUST always contain the following keys: "patent_id", "name", "address", "description", and "date".

Follow these explicit instructions for extracting the data for each field from the single entry provided:

1.  **`patent_id`**:
    *   Locate the numerical identifier at the very beginning of the entry string.
    *   Ignore any preceding characters like dashes (`-`), spaces, or list numbering.
    *   Extract *only* the digits as a single string value, with no whitespaces.
    *   If no numerical identifier can be reliably extracted, then set the value for the patent_id field to the string "NaN".

2.  **`name`**:
    *   Identify the name(s) or the company name of the patent holder(s). This typically follows the `patent_id`.
    *   It might be a person's name (e.g., `KLÖNNE, F. W.`), a full company name (e.g., `„VIEILLE MONTAGNE“, AKTIEN-GESELLSCHAFT FÜR BERGBAU- UND ZINKHÜTTENBETRIEB`), or multiple names joined by 'und' or '&' (e.g., `SCHIFFER & KIRCHER`).
    *   Capture the full name exactly as written, including commas, quotes, ampersands (`&`), and titles if they are part of the name entity. Assume the first name/company entity listed immediately after the ID is the holder, unless the text explicitly uses "Inh.:" to specify the holder.
    *   This must be the patent holder, *not* the representative ("Vertreter") if present.
    *   If no recognizable name or company entity can be reliably identified as patent holder(s), set the value for the name field to the string "NaN".

3.  **`address`**:
    *   Locate the address associated *specifically with the patent holder(s)* identified in the `name` field.
    *   This address information usually follows the holder's name directly and often starts with prepositions like `in` or `auf` (e.g., `in Ems`, `in Chênée, Belgien`, `auf Zeche „Fortschritt“ bei Dux in Böhmen`).
    *   Extract the entire address phrase exactly as written.
    *   Do *not* extract the address associated with the "Vertreter". The holder's address is typically located closer to the holder's name than any representative details.
    *   If no location phrase can be reliably identified in that position, set the value for the address field to the string "NaN".

4.  **`description`**:
    *   This field should contain the core descriptive text of the patent's subject matter.
    *   It often starts *after* the patent holder's `address`.
    *   It often ends *just before* the final `date` at the end of the entry.
    *   Extract the text exactly as written.
    *   **Crucially Important Exclusion 1:** If the entry contains information about a representative starting with "Vertreter:", this representative information (name, address, title) MUST be **completely excluded** from the `description` field. The description text often appears *after* these representative details if they are present.
    *   **Crucially Important Exclusion 2:** Explicitly **exclude** any parenthetical phrases indicating a patent addendum, such as `(Zusatz zum Patent 12345.)` or similar variations (like `(II. Zusatz zum Patent 17502.)`), from the `description` field. These phrases are often located near the end of the description or just before the date.
    *   If no descriptive text remains after applying exclusions, or if no text exists in this section, set the value for the description field to the string "NaN".

5.  **`date`**:
    *   Locate the date at the very end of the entry.
    *   Extract the date exactly as written, including the final period if present, as a string value.
    *   If the date cannot be identified reliably at the end of the entry, set the value for the date field to the string "NaN".

Only provide valid JSON. Nothing else.
